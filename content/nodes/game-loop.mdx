# The Game Loop

The **Game Loop** is the central code of your game. It runs continuously during gameplay.

## Key Phases

1. **Process Input**: Handle user commands.
2. **Update**: Advance game state.
3. **Render**: Draw the game to the screen.

```javascript
while (gameRunning) {
  processInput();
  update();
  render();
}
```

This cycle repeats 60 times per second (usually).
